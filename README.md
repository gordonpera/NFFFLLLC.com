## Fantasy Football Website Dev Repo
### Purpose: 
    Provide a unique and fun place for the league to interact and get real updates that doesn’t revolve around Facebook and the ESPN app.     Allows us to customize the experience and add new features and unique parts to customize the league for ourselves (i.e. Sacko, Water       Bets, etc.). Better place to keep our data as tit can be more protected and less of a target than a private Facebook group or the ESPN     group chat.

### Layout: 
    Three columns on top: Standings, Commentary, Message Board
    •	Standings: straightforward, can be done with either a weekly update or a webscrape of our ESPN site
    •	Commentary: Place for Kelley’s Korner, Paul’s Power Rankings, any future columns, could be as simple as a headline and maybe a                  short tagline like a news website (Buzzfeed, Deadspin, etc.)
    •	Message Board: functions like the Facebook group but for quick comments and posting of memes, funny stuff

    (Looking for good way to lay this out) Scroll down for quantitative analysis including:
         • Paul’s quantitative rankings 
         • Trevor’s Tableau Masterpieces

### Longer term projects:
    •	Live updating scores and supplementary data viz on Sundays along top of site, like NFL scores appear on ESPN.com
    •	Connecting all the quantitative aspects to the ESPN page via API or web scrape

### Questions:
    •	Best way to update articles? Archive old articles?
    •	Best to do in JS? Python? Both? Neither?
    •	Other features that could be cool?
